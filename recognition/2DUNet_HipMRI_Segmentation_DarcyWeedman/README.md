# 2D UNet for Prostate Cancer Segmentation in HipMRI

Author: Darcy Weedman\
Student ID: 45816985

## Task
The objective of this project is to accurately segment the prostate region in the HipMRI Study on Prostate Cancer using a 2D UNet architecture. Utilizing processed 2D slices available in NIfTI format, the model aims to achieve a minimum Dice similarity coefficient of **0.75** on the test set specifically for the prostate label. This segmentation task is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and aiding in treatment planning for prostate cancer patients.

## 2D UNet Architecture

### Overview of UNet
UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation. It features a symmetric encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that allow for precise localization and context capture, making it highly effective for segmentation tasks.

### Components of the 2D UNet

1. **Encoder (Contracting Path):**
   - **Double Convolution Layers:** Each step in the encoder consists of two consecutive convolutional layers followed by ReLU activations and batch normalization. This helps in extracting rich feature representations.
   - **Max Pooling:** Reduces the spatial dimensions, allowing the network to capture context at multiple scales.

2. **Decoder (Expanding Path):**
   - **Transposed Convolutions:** Upsample the feature maps to restore spatial dimensions.
   - **Skip Connections:** Concatenate corresponding feature maps from the encoder to preserve spatial information.
   - **Double Convolution Layers:** Refine the upsampled features for precise segmentation.

3. **Output Layer:**
   - **1x1 Convolution:** Maps the feature representation to the desired number of classes, producing the final segmentation mask.

## Training

### Data
The dataset comprises processed 2D slices from the HipMRI Study on Prostate Cancer, available in NIfTI (.nii.gz) format. Each slice includes annotations for different anatomical structures, with a focus on the prostate region.

### Preprocessing
- **Normalisation:** Images are normalised to have zero mean and unit variance to facilitate faster and more stable training.
- **Resizing:** All images and masks are resized to a target size of **256x256** pixels to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** For multi-class segmentation, masks are converted to one-hot encoded format to represent each class distinctly.

### Configuration
- **Batch Size:** 4
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Learning Rate:** 1e-4
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Functions:** Combination of Cross-Entropy Loss and Dice Loss to balance pixel-wise accuracy and overlap measures.
- **Scheduler:** ReduceLROnPlateau to adjust the learning rate based on validation performance.
- **Device:** GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 with 10GB GDDR6 memory) is utilised for accelerated training.

### Training Process
The training loop involves feeding batches of images and corresponding masks into the UNet model, computing the loss, performing backpropagation, and updating the model weights. Gradient clipping is employed to prevent exploding gradients, ensuring stable training.
