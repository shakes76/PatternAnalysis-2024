##3D-UNet for the HipMRI Study on Prostate Cancer

#Project Overview
The goal of the project is to perform segmentation on 3D medical images.it used the dataset of contains MRI scans and corresponding segmentation labels. Training the U-Net model on the scans to learn the segmentation task and then predicting accurate segmentation masks to evaluate.

#dataset Using
The dataset used in the project consists of 3D medical images in nifti format.

#Model Architecture
The project uses a 3D U-Net architecture, the network architecture is :

input channels: 1
Output channels:1
Features:32

The network consists of a contracting path(encoder) that captures context and a expnsive(decoder) path that enable precise localization. it uses binary cross-entropy as the loss function and evaluate performance using the DICE Coefficient, a common metric for segmentation tasks.

How it works:
	Input: it input to the model is a 3D MRI volume (include [depth, height, width])
	
	Network: it includes encoder and decoder.
		encoder: successive convolutional layers followed by max-pooling to downsample the spatial dimension, capturing higher-level features.
		
		decoder: Upsampling layers with skip connections from the encoder layers to recover spatial resolution and maintain feature localization.
	
	Output: it outputs a segmentation mask.
