"""
This module provides utility functions for handling image datasets, including loading datasets,
splitting them into training, validation, and test sets, and calculating dataset statistics
such as mean and standard deviation. These statistics are used for normalization to improve
the training process for deep learning models.

Key Functions:
1. `get_mean_std`: Computes the mean and standard deviation of a dataset.
2. `get_dataloaders`: Loads the dataset, applies transformations, and returns DataLoaders for 
   the training, validation, and test datasets.
3. `main`: Example function to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the training set.

Note: The mean and standard deviation should be calculated using only the training dataset
to avoid data leakage. These values should then be used to normalize the training, validation, and test datasets during model training.

Shuffling helps better convergence, and generalisation.
