# GCN On Facebook Dataset (47801725)

## Overview 
 Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are used for node classification by combining both labeled and unlabeled data within a graph to categorize nodes. These networks learn a function that maps each node's features and its topological strucutre within the graph to a corresponding label. Training involves using the known labels of a subset of nodes to refine the classification function, while also taking into account the  feature similarities with neighboring nodes. This method helps the model generalize and accurately predict the labels of nodes that lack labels, making it particularly useful when labeled data is limited.

In this report, we apply a GCN to the partially processed facebook dataset, where nodes represent official Facebook pages and edges denote mutual likes between these pages, in this specific dataset we have 4 categories and our task is to classify each node into a specfic category.
