Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /scratch/215216/matplotlib-83d4rtsf because the default path (/cache/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
GPU not available, modules are switching to CPU.
