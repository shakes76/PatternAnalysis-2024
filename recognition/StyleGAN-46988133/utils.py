    This function is called at the end of training the StyleGAN on a certain image resolution. Thus

    Both models will also be saved for later use in inference.
    
    Param: A discriminator model.
    Param: A generator model.
    Param: D_losses: The amount of losses the discriminator has occured so far.

    Param: current_resolution: The current resolution/image size that the gen and disc have been trained on.
    Param: current_depth: Also indicates the current resolution/image size.
