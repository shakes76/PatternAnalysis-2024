# COMP3710 Project

Task 8: 
```Create a generative model of one of the ADNI brain data set (see Appendix for links) using either a variant of StyleGAN [10]/StyleGAN2 [11] or Stable Diffusion [12] that has a “reasonably clear image”. You should also include a TSNE or UMAP embeddings plot with ground truth in colors and provide a brief interpretation/discussion. See recent UQ work for hints of how to incorporate labels in style [13]. [Hard Difficulty]```
