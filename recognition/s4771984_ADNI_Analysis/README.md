## Classification of Alzheimer's Disease (Normal or AD) using Transformers GFnet6

## Dataset Description
The ADNI (Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset is widely used dataset in Medical research and Machine Learning, especially for the studies related to the Alzheimer's disease. It was created to support the discovery for the biomakers for the early detection and progression of Alzheimer's disease. The dataset includes various types of data collected from patients, ranging from imaging data to genetic information and clinical assessments. 

## Key Features of the ADNI Dataset : 
### 1) Imaging Data
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) : In general, high-resolution structural imaging of the brain is conducted to analyze brain anatomy.
- Positron Emission Tomography(PET) : A type of functional imaging to evaluate activity of the brain; this usually targets amyloid and tau protein accumulation in the brain-perhaps the most well-known hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. 

### 2) Clinical and Demographic Data : 
- Participants' age, sex, education, and medical history are given, which may be useful in trying to correlate the clinical outcomes with Alzheimer's disease.

### 3) Diagnostic Lagels : 
- For the dataset given to us had two categories which are mentioned below.
- Cognitive Normal (CN) : People who are healthy and in whom there is no evidence of cognitive impairment.
- Alzheimer's Disease (AD) : This group consists of patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

### 4) Longitudinal Data :
- The dataset also includes longitudinal follow-ups where patients data is collected over time. This will help in the essential for studying the disease progression and effectiveness of interventions.
