modules.py: Implementations of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layers and models
This script implements a 3-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for semi-supervised 
node classification. It includes:

1. A GCNLayer class representing a single GCN layer that aggregates node features 
   from neighboring nodes using a normalized adjacency matrix.
2. A GCN class that constructs a 3-layer GCN model with batch normalization and dropout, 
   designed for node classification tasks. The final layer outputs class scores for each node, 
   which are converted to probabilities using log softmax.

The model can be used for semi-supervised learning tasks where some node labels are known 
for training, while the remaining nodes need to be classified.
